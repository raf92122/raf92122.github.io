		<p>As the youngest of four boys, I learned essential social skills in an early stage of my life. Throughout my childhood, I was never left alone. Instead I drowned in words and conversation. I believe this is a powerful and useful aspect of my character.
		Today, I cherish my relationship with my family and friends. I tend to rely on others to get through tough times.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In highschool, I found myself to be approachable by almost everyone in my grade. I became immersed into the culture of the school. By my senior year, I had nailed down positions like Varsity Football Captain and Tunstall Student Council Vice President.

		<p>Another one of my hobbies in doodling. I would draw when every I was around pencil and paper. Nothing too impressive because I was too impatient for long term projects. Here are some examples.</p>

		<p>My college life had been the biggest change in lifestyle and scenery I have ever gone through. Getting educated three states away from home has brought with it great change. That being said, I love UGA and the people here. Go Dawgs!</p>
